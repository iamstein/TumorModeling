\section*{Introduction}
In the development of biologics, understanding target engagement at the site of action plays a critical role in dose regimen selection \cite{wang16}.  As measurements at the site of action are often impossible to obtain, model based predictions of target engagement are often used to help justify the dose selection.  For example, for the PD-1 inhibitor pembrolizumab, a physiologically based model for antibody distribution and target engagement was developed to predict the dose needed to achieve target engagement and tumor suppression \cite{lindauer17}.  For the PD-L1 inhibitor atezolizumab, a much simpler approach was taken to help justify the dose regimen, where a particular tumor biodistribution coefficient ($B$) and in vivo binding affinity ($\Kd$) was assumed, the steady state trough concentration ($\Cmin$) was estimated from clinical observation and then the receptor occupancy ($RO$) formula in Equation~\ref{eq:ro} was used to identify the dosing regimen that would provide the drug concentration needed to achieve 95\% target occupancy.
\begin{equation}
RO = B\cdot\Cmin/(B\cdot\Cmin+\Kd)
\label{eq:ro}
\end{equation}

The advantage of using the complex, mechanistic model as done for pembrolizumab is that ideally, it captures all essential underlying physiology processes in making the dose regimen prediction.  The disadvantage of this approach however is that physiological models can be complex, making them difficult time consuming to develop and difficult to explain to collaborators.  The advantage using the simple RO formula as done for atezolizumab is that it is fast, easy to implement, and easy to explain to collaborators.  The disadvantage, however, is that it is not obvious that Equation~\ref{eq:ro} is appropriate to the clinical scenario as this equation was derived for the in vitro setting \cite{boeynaems80} where the was no drug distribution, target distribution, receptor synthesis, or receptor turnover.

In this paper, an analysis of the target mediated drug distribution system is is performed with the goal of deriving a simple expression for target engagement in the clinical scenario.  This work provides a simple expression for target engagement in the tissue of interest, extending previous work characterizing the Average Free target to Initial target Ratio (AFIR) at steady state in circulation \cite{stein17}.
