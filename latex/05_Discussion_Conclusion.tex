\section{Discussion}

\begin{itemize}
\item Key Insight = AFIRT
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Just need a few terms, don't need a big mechanistic model
		\item Mention affect of doubling dose, halving $\Kss$ etc.
			\subitem But halving $\Kss$ is different from halving $\Kd$.
	\end{itemize}
\item Review Assumptions needed for AFIRT to hold
	\begin{itemize}
		\item large drug concentration
		\item distribution of drug-target complex out of tissue can be ignored
		\item fluctuations during dosing interval can be ignored
		\item others?
	\end{itemize}
\item Importance of using $\Kss$ or even $\Kssd$ from cell based assays instead of $\Kd$.  The more realistic the preclinical system, the better.
\item Things that are ignored
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Feedback, though this would be easy to include.  Just need to have different ksyn for initial condition and steady state.
		\item Low-Intermediate concentrations, especially relevant for ADCs and bispecifics.
		\item Competition for target binding sites between drug and endogenous ligand.
	\end{itemize}
\item Applications
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Can rapidly assess new drugs
		\item Can help inform dose finding
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
